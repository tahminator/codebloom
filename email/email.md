# React Email Starter

Create a pretty email tempalate using React-y code.

## Getting Started

### Development

To preview the development server, you can use

```

or

```
cd email && pnpm i && pnpm email dev
```

### Generate HTML output

To generate the raw HTML from the React code and then send it to our Java server, we can do the following:

```
