# `.github/`

This directory holds the Codebloom infrastructure code. That includes workflows & composite actions directly interfacing with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) as well as scripts written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Bun Shell](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/shell) to handle more complex logic.

[View `.github/scripts` which includes it's own documentation](./scripts/)

## Commands

> [!NOTE]
> Every PR now includes an automatic action that will publish the list of all slash commands. As such, this section may be out of date and deprecated soon.

### Staging

All PRs must be tested in our staging environment to make sure that it won't break anything (if there's a reason it cannot be tested in staging, it must be indicated in the PR description).

To trigger deployment to staging, you just have to comment `/deploy` as a comment in the PR.

> [!NOTE]
> It should be a regular comment inside of the first page of the PR; writing the command as a review on a file or line(s) will not trigger deployment.

### AI Code Review

The following slash commands can be used in PR comments to trigger AI-powered code review:

| Command     | Description                                                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/ai`       | Triggers all AI review commands (`/review`, `/describe`, `/improve`) at once |
| `/review`   | Triggers an AI review of the PR changes                                      |
| `/describe` | Generates an AI-powered description of the PR                                |
| `/improve`  | Provides AI-powered suggestions                                              |

These commands use Qodo PR-Agent and integrate with Notion to include task context in reviews.
