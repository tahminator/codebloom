# Autoformatters

## Frontend

In the frontend, we are using:

- ESLint, which catches JavaScript/TypeScript code issues.
- Stylelint, which catches CSS and styling issues.
- Prettier, which formats code for consistency.

These will help us maintain good code quality and ensure readability and consistency.

To run the entire suite of tests, just run:

```bash
pnpm run test
```

And if there are any errors, be sure to fix it.

## Autofixes

If you have VSCode, make sure you have the following installed:

- Prettier - Code formatter
