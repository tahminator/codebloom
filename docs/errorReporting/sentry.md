# Error Reporting with Sentry

We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to monitor and report errors in our frontend applications. This enables us to track, investigate, and resolve issues quickly, improving reliability and user experience.

## Overview

Sentry is configured as follows:

-   **Frontend (React + Vite)**: Captures client-side errors, including rendering issues, unhandled exceptions, and performance bottlenecks.

## Frontend Configuration (React + Vite)
